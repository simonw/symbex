Find the Python code for specified symbols

Read [symbex: search Python code for functions and classes, then pipe them into a LLM](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jun/18/symbex/) for background on this project.

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:
```bash
pip install symbex
```
Or using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install simonw/llm/symbex
```
## Usage

`symbex` can search for names of functions and classes that occur at the top level of a Python file.

To search every `.py` file in your current directory and all subdirectories, run like this:

```bash
symbex my_function
```
You can search for more than one symbol at a time:
```bash
symbex my_function MyClass
```
Wildcards are supported - to search for every `test_` function run this (note the single quotes to avoid the shell interpreting the `*` as a wildcard):
```bash
symbex 'test_*'
```
To search for methods within classes, use `class.method` notation:
```bash
symbex Entry.get_absolute_url
```
Wildcards are supported here as well:
```bash
symbex 'Entry.*'
symbex '*.get_absolute_url'
symbex '*.get_*'
```
Or to view every method of every class:
```bash
symbex '*.*'
```
To search within a specific file, pass that file using the `-f` option. You can pass this more than once to search multiple files.

```bash
symbex MyClass -f my_file.py
```
To search within a specific directory and all of its subdirectories, use the `-d/--directory` option:
```bash
symbex Database -d ~/projects/datasette
```
If you know that you want to inspect one or more modules that can be imported by Python, you can use the `-m/--module name` option. This example shows the signatures for every symbol available in the `asyncio` package:
```bash
symbex -m asyncio -s --imports
```
You can search the directory containing the Python standard library using `--stdlib`. This can be useful for quickly looking up the source code for specific Python library functions:
```bash
symbex --stdlib -in to_thread
```
`-in` is explained below. If you provide `--stdlib` without any `-d` or `-f` options then `--silent` will be turned on automatically, since the standard library otherwise produces a number of different warnings.

The output starts like this:
```python
# from asyncio.threads import to_thread
async def to_thread(func, /, *args, **kwargs):
    """Asynchronously run function *func* in a separate thread.
    # ...
```
You can exclude files in specified directories using the `-x/--exclude` option:
```bash
symbex Database -d ~/projects/datasette -x ~/projects/datasette/tests
```
If `symbex` encounters any Python code that it cannot parse, it will print a warning message and continue searching:
```
# Syntax error in path/badcode.py: expected ':' (<unknown>, line 1)
```
Pass `--silent` to suppress these warnings:
```bash
symbex MyClass --silent
```
### Filters

In addition to searching for symbols, you can apply filters to the results.

The following filters are available:

- `--function` - only functions
- `--class` - only classes
- `--async` - only `async def` functions
- `--unasync` - only non-async functions
- `--documented` - functions/classes that have a docstring
- `--undocumented` - functions/classes that do not have a docstring
- `--public` - functions/classes that are public - don't have a `_name` prefix (or are `__*__` methods)
- `--private` - functions/classes that are private - have a `_name` prefix and are not `__*__`
- `--dunder` - functions matching `__*__` - this should usually be used with `*.*` to find all dunder methods
- `--typed` - functions that have at least one type annotation
- `--untyped` - functions that have no type annotations
- `--partially-typed` - functions that have some type annotations but not all
- `--fully-typed` - functions that have type annotations for every argument and the return value
- `--no-init` - Exclude `__init__(self)` methods. This is useful when combined with `--fully-typed '*.*'` to avoid returning `__init__(self)` methods that would otherwise be classified as fully typed, since `__init__` doesn't need argument or return type annotations.

For example, to see the signatures of every `async def` function in your project that doesn't have any type annotations:

```bash
symbex -s --async --untyped
```

For class methods instead of functions, you can combine filters with a symbol search argument of `*.*`.

This example shows the full source code of every class method in the Python standard library that has type annotations for all of the arguments and the return value:

```bash
symbex --fully-typed --no-init '*.*' --stdlib
```

To find all public functions and methods that lack documentation, just showing the signature of each one:

```bash
symbex '*' '*.*' --public --undocumented --signatures
```

### Example output

In a fresh checkout of [Datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette) I ran this command:

```bash
symbex MessagesDebugView get_long_description
```
Here's the output of the command:
```python
# File: setup.py Line: 5
def get_long_description():
    with open(
        os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "README.md"),
        encoding="utf8",
    ) as fp:
        return fp.read()

# File: datasette/views/special.py Line: 60
class PatternPortfolioView(View):
    async def get(self, request, datasette):
        await datasette.ensure_permissions(request.actor, ["view-instance"])
        return Response.html(
            await datasette.render_template(
                "patterns.html",
                request=request,
                view_name="patterns",
            )
        )
```
### Just the signatures

The `-s/--signatures` option will list just the signatures of the functions and classes, for example:
```bash
symbex -s -f symbex/lib.py
```
<!-- [[[cog
import cog
from click.testing import CliRunner
import pathlib
from symbex.cli import cli

def sorted_chunks(text):
    chunks = text.strip().split("\n\n")
    chunks.sort()
    return "\n\n".join(chunks)

path = pathlib.Path("symbex").resolve()
runner = CliRunner()
result = runner.invoke(cli, ["-s", "-f", str(path / "lib.py")])
cog.out(
    "```python\n{}\n```\n".format(sorted_chunks(result.output))
)
]]] -->
```python
# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 107
def function_definition(function_node: AST)

# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 13
def find_symbol_nodes(code: str, filename: str, symbols: Iterable[str]) -> List[Tuple[(AST, Optional[str])]]

# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 175
def class_definition(class_def)

# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 209
def annotation_definition(annotation: AST) -> str

# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 227
def read_file(path)

# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 253
class TypeSummary

# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 258
def type_summary(node: AST) -> Optional[TypeSummary]

# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 304
def quoted_string(s)

# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 315
def import_line_for_function(function_name: str, filepath: str, possible_root_dirs: List[str]) -> str

# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 37
def code_for_node(code: str, node: AST, class_name: str, signatures: bool, docstrings: bool) -> Tuple[(str, int)]

# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 71
def add_docstring(definition: str, node: AST, docstrings: bool, is_method: bool) -> str

# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 82
def match(name: str, symbols: Iterable[str]) -> bool
```
<!-- [[[end]]] -->
This can be combined with other options, or you can run `symbex -s` to see every symbol in the current directory and its subdirectories.

To include estimated import paths, such as `# from symbex.lib import match`, use `--imports`. These will be calculated relative to the directory you specified, or you can pass one or more `--sys-path` options to request that imports are calculated relative to those directories as if they were on `sys.path`:

```bash
~/dev/symbex/symbex match --imports -s --sys-path ~/dev/symbex
```
Example output:
<!-- [[[cog
result = runner.invoke(cli, [
    "--imports", "-d", str(path), "match", "-s", "--sys-path", str(path.parent)
])
cog.out(
    "```python\n{}\n```\n".format(result.stdout.strip())
)
]]] -->
```python
# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 82
# from symbex.lib import match
def match(name: str, symbols: Iterable[str]) -> bool
```
<!-- [[[end]]] -->
To suppress the `# File: ...` comments, use `--no-file` or `-n`.

So to both show import paths and suppress File comments, use `-in` as a shortcut:
```bash
symbex -in match
```
Output:
<!-- [[[cog
result = runner.invoke(cli, [
    "-in", "-d", str(path), "match", "-s", "--sys-path", str(path.parent)
])
cog.out(
    "```python\n{}\n```\n".format(result.stdout.strip())
)
]]] -->
```python
# from symbex.lib import match
def match(name: str, symbols: Iterable[str]) -> bool
```
<!-- [[[end]]] -->

To include docstrings in those signatures, use `--docstrings`:
```bash
symbex match --docstrings -f symbex/lib.py
```
Example output:
<!-- [[[cog
result = runner.invoke(cli, ["match", "--docstrings", "-f", str(path / "lib.py")])
cog.out(
    "```python\n{}\n```\n".format(result.stdout.strip())
)
]]] -->
```python
# File: symbex/lib.py Line: 82
def match(name: str, symbols: Iterable[str]) -> bool
    "Returns True if name matches any of the symbols, resolving wildcards"
```
<!-- [[[end]]] -->

## Counting symbols

If you just want to count the number of functions and classes that match your filters, use the `--count` option. Here's how to count your classes:

```bash
symbex --class --count
```
Or to count every async test function:
```bash
symbex --async 'test_*' --count
```

## Using with LLM

This tool is primarily designed to be used with [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/), a CLI tool for working with Large Language Models.

`symbex` makes it easy to grab a specific class or function and pass it to the `llm` command.

For example, I ran this in the Datasette repository root:

```bash
symbex Response | llm --system 'Explain this code, succinctly'
```
And got back this:

> This code defines a custom `Response` class with methods for returning HTTP responses. It includes methods for setting cookies, returning HTML, text, and JSON responses, and redirecting to a different URL. The `asgi_send` method sends the response to the client using the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) protocol.

## Replacing a matched symbol

The `--replace` option can be used to replace a single matched symbol with content piped in to standard input.

Given a file called `my_code.py` with the following content:
```python
def first_function():
    # This will be ignored
    pass

def second_function():
    # This will be replaced
    pass
```
Run the following:
```bash
echo "def second_function(a, b):
    # This is a replacement implementation
    return a + b + 3
" | symbex second_function --replace
```
The result will be an updated-in-place `my_code.py` containing the following:

```python
def first_function():
    # This will be ignored
    pass

def second_function(a, b):
    # This is a replacement implementation
    return a + b + 3
```
This feature should be used with care! I recommend only using this feature against code that is already checked into Git, so you can review changes it makes using `git diff` and revert them using `git checkout my_code.py`.

## Replacing a matched symbol by running a command

The `--rexec COMMAND` option can be used to replace a single matched symbol by running a command and using its output.

The command will be run with the matched symbol's definition piped to its standard input. The output of that command will be used as the replacement text.

Here's an example that uses `sed` to add a `# ` to the beginning of each matching line, effectively commenting out the matched function:

```bash
symbex first_function --rexec "sed 's/^/# /'"
```
This modified the first function in place to look like this:
```python
# def first_function():
#    # This will be ignored
#    pass
```
A much more exciting example uses LLM. This example will use the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model to add type hints and generate a docstring:

```bash
symbex second_function \
  --rexec "llm --system 'add type hints and a docstring'"
```
I ran this against this code:
```python
def first_function():
    # This will be ignored
    pass

def second_function(a, b):
    return a + b + 3
```
And the second function was updated in place to look like this:
```python
def second_function(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the sum of two integers (a and b) plus 3.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first integer.
    b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of a and b plus 3.
    """
    return a + b + 3
```
## Using in CI

The `--check` option causes `symbex` to return a non-zero exit code if any matches are found for your query.

You can use this in CI to guard against things like public functions being added without documentation:

```bash
symbex --function --public --undocumented --check
```
This will fail silently but set a `1` exit code if there are any undocumented functions.

Using this as a step in a CI tool such as GitHub Actions should result in a test failure.

Run this to see the exit code from the last command:
```bash
echo $?
```

`--check` will not output anything by default. Add `--count` to output a count of matching symbols, or `-s/--signatures` to output the signatures of the matching symbols, for example:
```bash
symbex --function --public --undocumented --check --count
```
